## âœ… Seismic Devnet Journey â€“ by @teremno

This repository documents my full interaction with the Seismic Devnet, including contract deployment, CLI testing, and contract extension.

### ðŸ”¹ Deployed Contract: `Counter.sol`
- Added a new `reset()` function to reset the counter to 0
- Added an `Incremented(uint256)` event to log each increment
- Successfully deployed the updated contract to Seismic Devnet

### ðŸ”¹ CLI Interaction
- Used `transact.sh` to simulate encrypted interactions with the contract
- Validated encrypted state changes and visibility thresholds

### ðŸ”¹ Tools Installed (on WSL Ubuntu)
- Rust, Bun, jq
- Seismic Foundry tools (`sforge`, `sanvil`, `scast`, `ssolc`)
- Full environment set up from scratch

### ðŸ”¹ Activity Transparency
All progress is tracked through commits in this repository for public visibility and accountability.

### ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
- Add more advanced logic to the contract
- Explore encrypted game flow with Walnut (when available)
